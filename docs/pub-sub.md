# Pub/Sub

The Pub/Sub API is implemented by `ValkeyClient` and `ValkeyCluster`.

## Pub/Sub with `ValkeyClient`

Pub/Sub requires a dedicated stand-alone client. You can easily get one by `.duplicate()`ing an existing `ValkeyClient`:

```typescript
const subscriber = client.duplicate();
subscriber.on('error', err => console.error(err));
await subscriber.connect();
```

When working with a `ValkeyCluster`, this is handled automatically for you.

### `sharded-channel-moved` event

`ValkeyClient` emits the `sharded-channel-moved` event when the ["cluster slot"](https://valkey.io/docs/reference/cluster-spec/#key-distribution-model) of a subscribed [Sharded Pub/Sub](https://valkey.io/docs/manual/pubsub/#sharded-pubsub) channel has been moved to another shard.

The event listener signature is as follows:
```typescript
(
  channel: string,
  listeners: {
    buffers: Set<Listener>;
    strings: Set<Listener>;
  }
)
```

## Subscribing

```javascript
const listener = (message, channel) => console.log(message, channel);
await client.subscribe('channel', listener);
await client.pSubscribe('channe*', listener);
// Use sSubscribe for sharded Pub/Sub:
await client.sSubscribe('channel', listener);
```

> ⚠️ Subscribing to the same channel more than once will create multiple listeners which will each be called when a message is recieved.

## Publishing

```javascript
await client.publish('channel', 'message');
// Use sPublish for sharded Pub/Sub:
await client.sPublish('channel', 'message');
```

## Unsubscribing

The code below unsubscribes all listeners from all channels.

```javascript
await client.unsubscribe();
await client.pUnsubscribe();
// Use sUnsubscribe for sharded Pub/Sub:
await client.sUnsubscribe();
```

To unsubscribe from specific channels:

```javascript
await client.unsubscribe('channel');
await client.unsubscribe(['1', '2']);
```

To unsubscribe a specific listener:

```javascript
await client.unsubscribe('channel', listener);
```

## Buffers

Publishing and subscribing using `Buffer`s is also supported:

```javascript
await subscriber.subscribe('channel', message => {
  console.log(message); // <Buffer 6d 65 73 73 61 67 65>
}, true); // true = subscribe in `Buffer` mode.

await subscriber.publish(Buffer.from('channel'), Buffer.from('message'));
```

> NOTE: Buffers and strings are supported both for the channel name and the message. You can mix and match these as desired.
